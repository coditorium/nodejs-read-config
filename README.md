# nodejs-read-config

The original author, @coditorium, has not responded to issues for years and appears to have abandoned this project. 

I have taken it over as "read-config-ng" and the new repo can be found here:

  [read-config-ng](https://github.com/billchurch/read-config-ng)

This is also installable through npm as `read-config-ng`
